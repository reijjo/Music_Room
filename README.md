# Music_Room

## About
Music Room is a collaborative mobile application focused on music listening and sharing experience. This project seeks to merge music consumption with social interaction by encouraging collective decision-making within groups of peers. The aim is to develop a mobile, connected, and collaborative application, emphasizing on client/server architecture, data storage, API utilization, and third-party SDK integration.

## Features:
The application offers several key features, including:

User: 
 - Users are required to create a personal account to use the application. User profiles store and update public, private, and friend-only information as well as users' musical preferences.
 - OAuth wiht Google and Facebook
   
 Music Track Vote: This feature allows users in a shared space (party, event, etc.) to suggest and vote for the next track to be played on the current playlist. Tracks with high votes go up in the playlist order.

 Music Control Delegation: Users can delegate control of music which is specific to each device attached to the user's account.

 Music Playlist Editor: This feature provides a space where friends and users with the same musical taste can collaborate to create playlists in real-time.

To effectively manage competition and access, the project demands visibility and license management for both the Music Track Vote and Music Playlist Editor features.
